# Project 1
For our project, we wanted to look into NCHS's metadata set, "Leading Causes of Death in the United States". This dataset includes the causes of death of civilians in the US from years 1999-2017, breaking down the number of deaths per state per year. 
From a quick skim of the data, heart disease is the leading cause of death nationwide. To supplement this dataset, we found another source from the CDC that breaks down "Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US Adults (35+) by State/Territory and County". We hope to use the supplemental dataset from 2013-2015 to provide more insight into the data we extract from the NCHS data as it includes more details such as a breakdown of the state and county as well as the ethnicity most prevalent in the county.
